# Basic HTML Portfolio

My first portfolio project built using only **HTML**.  
It includes a simple structure with header, navigation, main content, and footer sections.

## Features
- Semantic HTML structure
- Organized layout
- Easy to extend with CSS or Tailwind later
- Placeholder image for future design

##  Preview

`<img src="preview.png" alt="Preview">`
![Alt text](portfolio-preview.png)


##  Files
- `index.html` – Main HTML file  
- `portfolio-preview` – (Optional) file for image 
##  Future Plans
- Add CSS styling and responsive design  
- Include real project links in the navigation
- Host it using GitHub Pages
